AI Perfume Selector

Overview
The AI Perfume Selector is an innovative web-based application designed to help users discover and select perfumes tailored to their unique preferences. Using advanced artificial intelligence, the system analyzes a user’s inputs such as fragrance notes, personal preferences, and even mood, to recommend perfumes that align with their taste.

This project leverages machine learning algorithms and a personalized recommendation system to provide a seamless and enjoyable perfume selection experience. The interface is designed to be intuitive, ensuring that users can easily navigate and find the best fragrance suited for them.

Features

perfumes that match their preferences.
3.  **Mood-Based Selection**: Users can input their current mood, such as happy,
sad, or relaxed, to receive perfume suggestions that complement their emotional state.
4.  **User Profile Management**: Users can create and manage their profiles, saving their preferences and
recommended perfumes for future reference.
5.  **Search and Filter**: Users can search for perfumes by name, brand, or
fragrance note, and filter results based on their preferences.
6.  **Rating and Review System**: Users can rate and review perfumes, helping to improve
the recommendation system over time.
7.  **Integration with E-commerce Platforms**: The AI Perfume Selector can be integrated with e
-commerce platforms, allowing users to purchase recommended perfumes directly from the application.
